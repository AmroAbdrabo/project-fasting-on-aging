# Project: Three-stage FMD diet effect on aging 
## Milestones: 

1. Concept definition and literature review (3 weeks) 

2. Extract CPG sites which are indicative of biological aging using the Horvath and GKM age and compare to those found in literature (2 weeks) 

3. Train model dependent on lifestyle characteristics (smoking, alcohol consumption, and more) and the biomarkers found for aging in step 1 (3 weeks) 

4. Examine the cofounding effects from the lifestyle-relate variables (3 weeks) 

5. Compare the performance of the model found in step 2 to a model trained using only biomarkers (1 week) 

6. Create Python package that analyzes and visualizes DNA methylation and age (3 weeks)
